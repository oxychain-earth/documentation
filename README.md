# Introduction

Oxychain is an on-chain solution to create interoperability between the carbon markets and the digital world with software infrastructure for on-chain compensation.  Oxy Labs, the company behind it, aims to bring transformative solutions to the conventional Carbon Markets with a focus on capillarity, accessibility, and interoperability.

Oxychain® aims to create the tools \(APIs\) to help in the neutralization of whole networks, supply-Chains, production-Lines, and communities.  Their strategy relies on the spread effect of the crypto DeFi ecosystem to create a universal value unit for biodiversity. By creating a liquidity pool out of pre-existing Verified Carbon Units \(VCU\), these credits represent CO2 until they are offset when they transfer their value to a much healthier layer and start their journey on the Oxychain®. Each new token \(OXY\) represents a ton\*\* of oxygen instead of carbon, which means as a massive number of regeneration & preservation projects flourish from this ecosystem, a whole community of local workforce is dedicated to our lands, water supplies, soil recovery, forests and much more. 

Oxychain® believes that anyone who cares for our environment can contribute by investing in this ecosystem that has many benefits such as soil-recovery, local community development, GHG emissions reduction, sustainable agriculture and watershed, land preservation, reforestation, air quality, ocean life, etc.
